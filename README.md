# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is created with [Create React App].


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
 run the command in the new terminal. This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see some small errors in the console, which can be ignored.

Note :- I am attaching a different file named 'screenshots' with the project which contains the screen-shots of the running project.
